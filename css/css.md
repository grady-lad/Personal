# Random css
- The :target selector allows us to interact with a fragment identifier, or hash, in our URL from CSS.
- use `>` to style only direct childs of that div e.g. `section > a`
- To style the adjacent sibling div use `+` e.g. `section h2 + p` will style only the p tag that comes after the h2 within section.
- To style all the sibilings after a div use `section h1 ~ *`
- create a selector in chrome. Right click an element within the element view and click copy selector. Go to the style tab and paste your selector within a new style and modify it to your needs :)
